# Plant Disease Classification with EfficientNetB0

## Project Overview
This project builds a deep learning model to classify plant leaf images into multiple disease categories. Early detection of plant diseases is crucial for improving crop yield and preventing losses in agriculture.  

Using **EfficientNetB0**, a state-of-the-art CNN architecture, the model achieves high accuracy on the **New Plant Diseases Dataset (Augmented)** from Kaggle.

## Dataset
- **Source**: [New Plant Diseases Dataset (Augmented)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vipoooool/new-plant-diseases-dataset)  
- **Classes**: 38 different plant diseases + healthy leaves  
- **Split**: Provided train/validation/test folders  

---

##  Tech Stack
- **Language**: Python  
- **Frameworks**: PyTorch, Torchvision  
- **Other tools**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, KaggleHub, Google Colab  

---

## Approach
1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Image resizing to 224×224  
   - Normalization (ImageNet mean/std)  
   - Train/validation/test split  

2. **Model**
   - EfficientNetB0 (transfer learning)  
   - Adam optimizer, learning rate scheduling  
   - Gradient clipping + weight decay  

3. **Training**
   - Batch size = 32, Epochs = 10  
   - Trained on GPU (Google Colab)  

4. **Evaluation**
   - Accuracy and loss tracking  
   - Visualization of predictions  

5. **Deployment**
   - Trained model saved as `.pth`  
   - Inference script with UI for testing on new images  

---

## Results
- Achieved strong classification accuracy on validation & test sets.  
- Visualizations show good generalization across disease categories.

## How to Run
1. Clone this repo:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/DarshanKanani05/plant-disease-classification.git
   cd plant-disease-classification
   ```
2. Install dependencies:  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
